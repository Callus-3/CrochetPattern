An app in order to browse and create crochet patterns
Simply download to install.
Browse patterns while being able to filter by type or skill level
Implements recyclerviews, view models, bottom navigation, fragments, menus and activities.

I would like to eventually implement the ability to have a collection of projects in progress. And the ability for pattern authors to add photos for each step of the pattern.
